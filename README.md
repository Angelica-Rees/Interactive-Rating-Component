## Overview

This interactive rating allows users to select a rating and brings them to the thank you screen, which has a button to allow them to rate again, bringing them back to the original rating screen.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## My process

Initially I analyzed the photos for what elements would be needed and created an HTML file with the layout for the component before using CSS to style it. Most of this was done without help from sources. Afterwards, to refine and make the interactive components I followed the steps of a youtube tutorial by TsbSankara (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw). 


### What I learned

While doing this project, I learned about making hidden screens and adding event listeners in Javascript to hide and unhide these screens. Additionally, I learned about using pseudoclasses in CSS to make different transitions, background-colors, text colors, and more happen to elements when hovered over or clicked on. 


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to go more in depth in the JS code to make interactivity even more interesting. 

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge TsbSankara for thier very helpful tutorial regarding this project. It was extremely useful to bettering my understanding of Javascript. I'd also like to acknowledge my partner, Thomas, who codes for work and helped me understand some of the fundamental skills that I used in this project.
